This isn't really software, and I'm not one to do legal hurdles. So I'll try to keep this short. I know there's licenses out there that probably go over
exactly what I want, but I would like to write things on my own rules. Since this is something I have been working on.

To clarify, "I" means YakuzaDoggo. "You" means anyone who contributes this repo, engages in any form of change to this repo, or
anyone who creates a fork of this repo. "Repo" means the repository this license, and to further extent, all assets of this resource pack is on. 
"Work" is any type of creative concept that is able to be applied to this repo, think images, sounds, etc. 
"Variation" is some spin off (e.g. a fork) of this existing repo.

To put it simply, you are allowed to make any changes you see fit to your own version of this pack. In other words, if you fork this repo, you are allowed to do 
what ever you want. All that I ask of you is that you include somewhere in your readme something acknowledging this repo 
as a source/foundation for your own repo. If you make your own variation, you are to make it open-source. However, you are allowed to change the license to another open source license that you may see fit.

If you contribute to this repo specifically, you own the rights to any work you put in, unless the work belongs to someone else (e.g. the PlayStation 2 startup sound is
part of the PlayStation 2 bios, which belongs to Sony Interactive Entertainment). At your own request, if you wish to no longer associate your work with this repo,
you are free to contact me through proper channels to take any work you wish to remove.
