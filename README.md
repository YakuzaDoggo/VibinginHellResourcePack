## Fair Warning
Some textures/audio/text may be questionable, NSFW, overloading to the eyes or ears and just plain stupid. Don't expect this to be a serious resource pack.

## Installation 
Simply download the ZIP file. Then send the folder named "Vibing in Hell" to your Minecraft resource pack (the directory should be <b> /.minecraft/resourcepacks/ </b> in your roaming appdata folder.)

## Roadmap
You can find the roadmap on Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/tOSmUeIA/vibin-in-hell-resource-pack).
